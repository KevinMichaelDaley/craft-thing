# Restore displayed bonfire frame budget below30ms before siege expansion

Actual fullscreen Wayland Vulkan benchmark at480x270 physics/render with640x448 halo regressed to101.693ms mean106.760ms worst. First run reached1154 measured frames before120s bound. Functional native tests and full regression are green, but performance is not. Profile and fix inline before coal/siege expansion; do not revisit stable smoke numerics or fake performance through lower physical clock/resolution, flame point caching or headless-only evidence.

## Acceptance Criteria

Real displayed full-frame mean and worst below30ms on this machine over the autonomous finite-fuel bonfire, including all logs catching and sustained moving flames. Preserve current physics/render resolution, normal physical clock and eight rigid logs per pit, wet controls, finite energy/O2 and solid-only subtle2D conduction. Profiling/tools stay in repository; no fixed body counts. Full relevant native integration tests and regression pass, changes pushed.
